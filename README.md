# Building-synthetic-chromosomes-from-natural-DNA

Abstract

De novo chromosome synthesis is costly and time-consuming, limiting its use in research and biotechnology. Building synthetic chromosomes from natural components is an unexplored alternative with many potential applications. In this paper, we report CReATiNG (Cloning, Reprogramming, and Assembling Tiled Natural Genomic DNA), a method for constructing synthetic chromosomes from natural components in yeast. CReATiNG entails cloning segments of natural chromosomes and then programmably assembling them into synthetic chromosomes that can replace the native chromosomes in cells. We used CReATiNG to synthetically recombine chromosomes between strains and species, to modify chromosome structure, and to delete many linked, non-adjacent regions totaling 39% of a chromosome. The multiplex deletion experiment revealed that CReATiNG also enables recovery from flaws in synthetic chromosome design via recombination between a synthetic chromosome and its native counterpart. CReATiNG facilitates the application of chromosome synthesis to diverse biological problems.
